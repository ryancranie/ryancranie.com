So after hours of trying to import a Jekyll theme, I finally have one up and running. It feels great.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

I'll try a code snippet.

```py
def print_hi(name):
  name = input("What's your name? ")
  print("Hi",name)
print_hi()
# COMMENT.
```
Some links for myself so I can know where to go.
